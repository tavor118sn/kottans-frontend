## General

### Git Basics 

It was good to refresh the knowledge about git and different git commands.
git rebase definitely helps to keep git history clearer.


### Linux CLI and HTTP

I liked site about Linux because you can read theory and practice after that.
It has a good explanation about base commands, permissions, etc.
I would recommend this site to everyone who wants to learn Linux.

ALso information about HTTP was useful. But I would add a simple article about
REST API, to better understand where and how statuses and methods are used.
